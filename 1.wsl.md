## Step 1: Enable the WSL Feature

2. Run the following command to enable WSL:

   ```bash
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
   ```
3. If you want to install WSL 2 (recommended), also run:

   ```bash
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
   ```
4. Restart your computer.

## Step 2: Install Ubuntu

1. Open the Microsoft Store.
2. Search for "Ubuntu".
3. Choose the version of Ubuntu you want to install (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) and click **Get**.
4. Once the installation is complete, click **Launch** or search for "Ubuntu" in the Start Menu.

OR

- View default distro, check version

  ```powershell
  wsl.exe --list --verbose
  ```
- Unregister distro

  ```powershell
  wsl.exe --unregister <Distro>
  ```
- To view available WSL distributions:

  wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
  ```
- If you haven't set up WSL yet, you can install the default WSL distribution (usually Ubuntu) with:

  ```powershell
  wsl --install
  ```
- After installation, launch the distribution by typing:

  ```powershell
  wsl
  ```

  or search for the installed distribution in the Start Menu.

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

## Step 5: Update and Upgrade Ubuntu
