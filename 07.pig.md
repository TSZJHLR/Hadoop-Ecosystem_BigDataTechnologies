# Apache Pig Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and configure Apache Pig on a Linux system.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before installing Apache Pig, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Pig requires Java to run. Ensure that Java is installed and set up correctly.


## Step 2: Download Apache Pig

Download the latest stable version of Apache Pig from the official website or using the following `wget` command:

```bash
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/pig/latest/pig-0.17.0.tar.gz
```

## Step 3: Extract the Downloaded Archive

Extract the downloaded Pig tarball:

```bash
tar -xzvf pig-0.17.0.tar.gz
```

## Step 4: Move Pig to the Desired Directory

Move the extracted Pig directory to your preferred installation path:

```bash
sudo mv pig-0.17.0 /usr/local/pig
```

## Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables
   ```bash
    java --version
   readlink -f $(which javac)
   ```
To ensure that Pig is accessible from any directory, add Pig to your system's environment variables.

1. Open your `.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

   ```bash
   # pig
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
   export PIG_HOME=/usr/local/pig
   export PATH=$PATH:$PIG_HOME/bin
   ```
3. Save and close the file, then apply the changes:
   `Ctrl + S`, `Ctrl + O`, `[Enter]`, `Ctrl + X`
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## Step 6: Verify the Installation

Check that Pig is installed correctly by running:

```bash
pig -version
```

You should see the version information for Apache Pig.

## Step 7: Run Pig in Local Mode

You can run Pig in local mode to process data stored in the local filesystem:

```bash
pig -x local
```

This command opens the Pig Grunt shell in local mode, allowing you to execute Pig Latin scripts directly.

## Step 8: Run Pig in MapReduce Mode

To run Pig in MapReduce mode (which requires a running Hadoop cluster):

```bash
pig
```

This command starts Pig in MapReduce mode, where it processes data stored in HDFS and runs on a Hadoop cluster.

## Step 9: Running a Sample Pig Script

You can create a sample Pig script to verify that Pig is working correctly:

1. Create a file named `sample.pig`:

   ```bash
   nano sample.pig
   ```
2. Add the following Pig Latin script to the file:

   ```pig
   A = LOAD 'sample_data.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (field1:int, field2:chararray, field3:float);
   B = FOREACH A GENERATE field1, field2;
   STORE B INTO 'output_data.txt' USING PigStorage(',');
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   pig -x local sample.pig
   ```

This command processes the `sample_data.txt` file and stores the output in `output_data.txt`.

## Step 10: Clean Up

If you no longer need the installation files, you can remove them:

```bash
rm pig-0.17.0.tar.gz
```
